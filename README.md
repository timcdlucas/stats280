# stats280

This repo contains all the notes, ideas, scripts and figures for the twitter statistics course I am attempting to write.

The hashtag for the course is #stats280. 280 characters on twitter and it's a statistics course.


## Folders and files

* `*.Rmd` Markdown files containing code and text to create figures and explain content.
* `notes_and_ideas` Lose ends, test scripts, etc.
* `figures` All figures.
