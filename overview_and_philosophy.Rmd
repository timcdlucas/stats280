# stats280

## An overview:

I'm going to start this twitter stats course now #stats280. I'll be 
aiming it at UG bios with a little background knowledge. I won't do
a dedicated probability section but will try to explain everything as I go.

However, it's a stats course, not an R course. I'll assume tidyverse 
and modelr are loaded, but otherwise include pkg info. I like this R
course as a starter. #stats280 http://dzchilds.github.io/aps-data-analysis-L1/ 

I'm using a github repo. But once I get going I will storify the tweets 
and interesting replies. Feel free to PR or open issues on github. #stats280

Some principles: I'll focus on general understanding, not learning a 
long list of specific tests. Sims to explore, understand and check things 
is great. #dataviz is vital. I am agnostic between frequentism, bayes 
and machine learning. #stats280



The three broad tasks in statistics are exploration, prediction and 
confirmation/hypothesis testing. #stats280

```{setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(modelr)
```


```{pipeline_setu}p
# One model

## Model selection performed differently
## Parameter selection performed differently.

## Compare y ~ X1 + 1, y ~ 1


ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp, mpg)) + geom_point()
```


```{pipeline1}
## Fit by absolute error
## Compare by crossvalidation.

library(quantreg)
crossv_mc(mtcars, 10) %>% 
  mutate(m1 = map(.$train, ~rq(mpg ~ disp, dat=.)),
         m2 = map(.$train, ~rq(mpg ~ 1, dat=.))) %>% 
  summarise(e1 = mean(map2_dbl(m1, .$test, mae)), 
            e2 = mean(map2_dbl(m2, .$test, mae)))
```

```{pipeline2}
## Fit by maximum likelihood
## Compare with frequentist aov

f1 = lm(mpg ~ disp + 1, mtcars)
f2 = lm(mpg ~ 1, mtcars)

anova(f1, f2)
```


```{pipeline3}


## Fit by bayes
## Compare by bayesuan waic
library(INLA)
b1 = inla(mpg ~ disp + 1, data =  mtcars, control.compute=list(waic=TRUE))
b2 = inla(mpg ~ 1, data = mtcars, control.compute=list(waic=TRUE))
b1$mlik[1] - b2$mlik[1]
```
